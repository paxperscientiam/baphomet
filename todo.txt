when listing buffers indicate if saved or not
buffer opening should correspond to buffer list
method to page file buffer anywhere
directly use tramp
prolly need to test for s library
baphomet buffer could be a HELP buffer

option to hard kill
daemons should have lock to prevent unauthroized access
use escape codes to update tab name
add option to designate default daemon
enforce specific daemon with optional file in project directory naming desired daemon
when listing buffers to stdout should somehow indicate relative depth
what about being to hook into a project
grep completion for buffer list
new daemons might respect project roots
