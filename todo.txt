buffer opening should correspond to buffer list
method to page file buffer anywhere
directly use tramp
prolly need to test for s library


option to hard kill
daemons should have lock to prevent unauthroized access
use escape codes to update tab name

enforce specific daemon with optional file in project directory naming desired daemon
when listing buffers to stdout should somehow indicate relative depth
what about being to hook into a project


filter out message buffers

buffer list should be alphanumeric

read desired daemon name from pwd
how to send message to client through socket?
requested daemon name is the socket in the pwd
attempting to join a nonexistent daemon should prompt to create that daemon
can i drop nc dependency
specified buffer not created when daemon is implicit
use new code for searching for config files
TCP
make variables case-insensitive
config variables should be case insensitive

variables should be declared
use caching
restart daemon option that will also reopen buffers
wait mode for joining a daemon after it is summoned

indicate if daemon is busy or hanging


use this for moving over to server method https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/draft/manual/html_node/emacs/TCP-Emacs-server.html#TCP-Emacs-server

Consider implementing persistant state
pipe buffer to less for peaking
why not just user default server directory?
add monitor modes if watch is present
handle shorthand switches as with -wy
if communication with socket hangs test
use better colors in dialog
interactive mode not handling multiple daemon slayings
wipe should allow to specify which socket to remove
quick load multiple daemons
Make so daemon is named for where the file is and not from where it is selected from
