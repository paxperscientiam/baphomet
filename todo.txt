buffer opening should correspond to buffer list
method to page file buffer anywhere
directly use tramp
prolly need to test for s library


option to hard kill
daemons should have lock to prevent unauthroized access
use escape codes to update tab name
add option to designate default daemon
enforce specific daemon with optional file in project directory naming desired daemon
when listing buffers to stdout should somehow indicate relative depth
what about being to hook into a project
grep completion for buffer list
new daemons might respect project roots
filter out message buffers

buffer list should be alphanumeric
list the daemon PID also
read desired daemon name from pwd
how to send message to client through socket?
requested daemon name is the socket in the pwd
attempting to join a nonexistent daemon should prompt to create that daemon
can i drop nc dependency
specified buffer not created when daemon is implicit
use new code for searching for config files
TCP
