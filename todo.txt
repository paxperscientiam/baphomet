buffer opening should correspond to buffer list
method to page file buffer anywhere
directly use tramp
prolly need to test for s library


option to hard kill
daemons should have lock to prevent unauthroized access
use escape codes to update tab name

enforce specific daemon with optional file in project directory naming desired daemon
when listing buffers to stdout should somehow indicate relative depth
what about being to hook into a project

new daemons might respect project roots
filter out message buffers

buffer list should be alphanumeric

read desired daemon name from pwd
how to send message to client through socket?
requested daemon name is the socket in the pwd
attempting to join a nonexistent daemon should prompt to create that daemon
can i drop nc dependency
specified buffer not created when daemon is implicit
use new code for searching for config files
TCP
make variables case-insensitive
config variables should be case insensitive
use git as root if present
variables should be declared
use caching
restart daemon option that will also reopen buffers
wait mode for joining a daemon after it is summoned
running emacs -k should be considered interactive and thus a kill should be followed by another kill prompt
indicate if daemon is busy or hanging
listing daemons with buffers should pipe to less so as not to pollute terminal
Option to use a companion shell buffer for listngs as in emacs -y > /dev/ttys008
use this for moving over to server method https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/draft/manual/html_node/emacs/TCP-Emacs-server.html#TCP-Emacs-server
need a wipe feature to clean dead or corrupted sessions
Consider implementing persistant state
pipe buffer to less for peaking
